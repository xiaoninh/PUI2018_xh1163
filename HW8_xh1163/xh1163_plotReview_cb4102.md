### Review:

#### The title is a clear description of the data that is represented, though perhaps the date "2014 Feb" could be included at the end of the description rather than the beginning.

#### Axis are labeled clearly and correctly with the units identified. One small thing is that, from my knowledge of Citibike data, it is not "number of bikers" it is "number of rides". A biker could take multiple rides in a day and their age would be counted each time they took a ride.

#### The plot description and analysis could be more detailed. For example, perhaps making a comment about the relative differences across days of the week. 

#### Plot type: Since you are comparing relative quantities, you could consider using a stacked bar, rather than side by side bars. In addition, you could consider a % stacked bar rather than absolute values, since the purpose of the graphic seems to be the relative ridership by age by day of the week, rather than absolute volume.
