This is a file which reviews plots created by xh1163.

xh1163 created a figure which describes the relationship between Day of week and the number of riders age under and over 40 in February 2014.

CLARITY: This figure clearly shows the absolute numbers for each age group. If the graph is for comparing the absolute number of younge age group to that of old age group, this is fine. However, if you want to discuss the difference between the shapes of two distributions, you could use distributions of percentages instead of absolute numbers. Depends on the purpose of the graph though. Also, possibly, there is a typo in the title.

ESTHETIC: The figure is simple and easy to understand. xh1163 uses blue and orange so that people with most types of color blind can understand the difference. Quantities are easy to understand.

HONESTY: xh1163 shows the original code, so I can say that the graph is reproduceble. In fact, I successed to download the original data from the link mentioned in the original code.
